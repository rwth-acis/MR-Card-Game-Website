## How to Setup the Game

### Quizzes
In order to play the MR Card Game, you will also need a pre-build quiz from which the questions are asked during the game. You can either create this quiz yourself using the MR Card Game Question Creator Tool which you can download [here](https://github.com/rwth-acis/MR-Question-Creator-For-Card-Game), or you can simply download a pre-built quiz in the app. Simply select `Download Levels` in the Main Menu and click on any of the quizzes that interest you. They are immediately downloaded and ready to play in the `Play Levels` section in the Main Menu.

After creating or downloading a quiz, the quiz folder has to be placed on your device in the following folder:
- **Android:** `\Card\Android\data\com.RWTH-ACIS.MRCardGame\files\` 
- **Windows:** `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\LocalLow\RWTH-ACIS\MR Card Game`

This is important otherwise the quiz won't show up in the app.
