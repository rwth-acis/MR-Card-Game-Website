## How to Play the Game
After successfully starting a game as described in the `Play Levels` section, the game starts with the setup phase. In the in-game UI you will see the starting `Currency` of 150. Players can use this currency to buy towers, traps and spells in the game. The `Wave` counter will also be visible and currently set to 0 as no wave has started yet. With the start of each wave this counter will increase. Right next to it you can find the `Start next wave` button which upon being pressed, will start the first wave. Lastly, the cross in the top right corner allows you to give up and return to the main menu.

### The Game Board

To start, place the **Board** card firmly within the camera field, preferably on a flat surface. The AR camera will detect the card and display the game board on top of it. The board consists of many components. The castle that is connected to the stone path is your main base of defense. This is the castle you have to protect from the invading enemies. Every time an enemy enters the castle, the castle will take damage depending on the enemy type. The castle's health is displayed above it as a green bar that will grow increasingly red the more damage it takes. The stone path, the castle is connected to, is the walk path of the enemies. They will spawn at the Portal placed opposite of the castle and walk all the way around the woods in the middle along the stone path to reach the castle. But while they are walking toward the castle, they are vulnerable to your attacks. Use this to your advantage to strategically play and place defenses along this path to protect the castle.

### The Setup Phase (Wave 0)
The game always starts in the Setup Phase (Wave 0) and will only start Wave 1 if the `Start next wave` button is clicked. Until then, players have time to set up towers and traps to stop the attackers in the coming waves. How to play each type of defense will be explained in more detail in the upcoming sections. Use this setup time wisely and prepare for the first wave. If you are ready, start the first wave.

### Tower Cards
In order to build towers on the board, players have to place the **Tower** card within the camera field and on a position on the board. Towers can only be built on the game board. When placed correctly, two buttons will appear over the card: `Build Tower` and `Build Trap`. Click on `Build Tower` and select the kind of tower that you want to build in the menu that now opened. Towers that the player cannot afford aren't available. During this building process the game is paused. The question counter will increase by 1 and you will be able to press the new button in the top right corner to answer the question necessary to build the tower (see the *Answering Questions* section). If the player correctly answered the question, the tower will be built and immediately start attacking enemies in range. (For information on individual tower effects, check the in-game *Gallery*.)

### Trap Cards
In order to build traps on the board, players have to place the **Tower** card within the camera field and on a position on the board. Traps can only be built on the game board. When placed correctly, two buttons will appear over the card: `Build Tower` and `Build Trap`. Click on `Build Trap` and select the kind of trap that you want to build in the menu that now opened. Traps that the player cannot afford aren't available. During this building process the game is paused. The question counter will increase by 1 and you will be able to press the new button in the top right corner to answer the question necessary to build the trap (see the *Answering Questions* section). If the player correctly answered the question, the trap will be built and immediately effect enemies walking over it. (For information on individual trap effects, check the in-game *Gallery*.)

### Spell Cards
In order to cast spells, players have to place one of the seven different **Spell** cards within the camera field. A new text will appear on the card saying `Draw Spell`, which if clicked upon, will allow players to draw a spell card to later play it. The question counter will increase by 1 and you will be able to press the new button in the top right corner to answer the question necessary to unlock the spell (see the *Answering Questions* section). If the player correctly answered the question, the spell will be unlocked, meaning the next time the spell card is held into the camera, the player will be see a new text on the card saying `Play X` where *X* is the name of the spell. By pressing it, the spell is played and its effect resolved. (For information on individual spell effects, check the in-game *Gallery*.)

### Answering Questions
The answering of questions will always be prompted by the player if they want to play a spell, tower or trap card. If so, the question counter will increase by 1 and you will be able to press the new button in the top right corner to answer the question. A random question from the selected quiz will then appear on the lower half of the screen. Questions can either be multiple-choice or input questions. Read the question carefully and if it is a multiple-choice question, select one of the answers and press the `Enter` button. If you accidentally selected a wrong answer, pressing the answer again will unselect it. If it is an input question, click on the input bar and enter your answer using the keyboard. Afterwards, also press `Enter` to submit it. If your answer is correct, the respective effect of the card is resolved as described in the above sections. If not, the card needs to be played again.
